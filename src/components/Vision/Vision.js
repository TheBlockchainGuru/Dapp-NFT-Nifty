                    <p>Nifty.io is the first community driven NFT development platform of this type and scope. This is a long-term project with many facets under development centered around the community; the Nodestone NFT holders. We are tying together some of the greatest achievements and will be building some of the most ambitious projects to date.</p>
                    <p>We began the nifty.io project to sustain the long-term potential of NFTs for the amazing community. We are coordinating efforts to develop aspects we see missing from current projects. To do this, we have designed nifty.io as a platform that will act as an incubator for projects in 6 categories we call realms.</p>
                    <p>It starts with minting a Nodestone. We call Nodestones the ultimate utility NFT token. Our goal is to give you ongoing value as long as you hold it. To reach our collective potential join the community.</p>
